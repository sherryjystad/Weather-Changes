What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Now, we know what you may be thinking: "Duh. It gets hotter..."
But, if pressed, how would you prove it?

In this project, a Python script is created to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, a simple Python library will be utilized, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.
