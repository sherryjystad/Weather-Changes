What's the weather like as we approach the equator? Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability, I know what you may be thinking: "Obviously. It gets hotter..."But, if pressed, how would I prove it?

For this analysis I have created a simple Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, a simple Python library called citipy was utilized, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little voodoo to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Objective:
 A series of scatter plots were created to showcase the following relationships

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude:

Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

•According to Cloudy earth, NASA, The band near the equator is a function of the large scale circulation patterns—or Hadley cells—present in the tropics. Hadley cells are defined by cool air sinking near the 30 degree latitude line north and south of the equator and warm air rising near the equator where winds from separate Hadley cells converge(https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/cloudy-earth)


* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

•	Near the equator, the trade winds converge into a broad east to west area of lightwinds. The area is known as the doldrums because there are light winds. ... Also at the equator, warmer, moist air rises and produces a low-pressure area extending many kilometers north and south of the equator.( www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/content/resources/global-wind-patterns.php)
